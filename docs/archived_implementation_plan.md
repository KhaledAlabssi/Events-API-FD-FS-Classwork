# React Events App - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for building the React Events application. It covers the step-by-step tasks, file structure, routing, component breakdown, and wireframes.

## 1. Step-by-Step Task Breakdown

This project is broken down into several manageable tasks. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth development process.

| Task ID | Task Name | Description/How-To |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| T01 | Project Setup | Initialize a new React project using Vite. Run `npm create vite@latest my-events-app -- --template react` in your terminal. |
| T02 | API Setup | Clone the events API from the provided GitHub repository. Follow the README.md instructions to install and run the API server locally. |
| T03 | Styling Setup | Install and configure Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling. |
| T04 | Routing Setup | Install React Router DOM and set up the main application routes. |
| T05 | Component Scaffolding | Create the basic file structure and empty component files. |
| T06 | Home Page - Event List | Implement the home page to fetch and display a list of events from the `/api/events` endpoint. |
| T07 | Event Card Component | Build a reusable EventCard to display summary information for each event. |
| T08 | Event Details Page | Create the page to display detailed information for a single event, fetched from `/api/events/:id`. |
| T09 | Sign-Up Page & Form | Develop the user registration page and form, which sends a POST request to `/api/users/register`. |
| T10 | Sign-In Page & Form | Create the user login page and form, which sends a POST request to `/api/auth/login`. |
| T11 | API Token Management | Store the authentication token received upon login in localStorage. |
| T12 | Protected Routes | Implement a ProtectedRoute component to restrict access to authenticated users only. |
| T13 | Create Event Page | Build the form for creating a new event, accessible only via a protected route. |
| T14 | Token Injection | Attach the authentication token to the headers of all necessary API requests. |
| T15 | Error Handling | Implement user-friendly error messages for API and network issues. |
| T16 | Responsive Design | Ensure the UI is fully responsive across mobile and desktop devices using Tailwind CSS. |
| T17 | Deployment | Build the application for production (`npm run build`) and deploy it to a static hosting service. |
| T18 | Code Quality & Git | Maintain a clean codebase and use a public GitHub repository with pull requests for all changes. |

## 2. File Structure

A well-organized file structure is key to a maintainable project.

```
/my-events-app
|-- /src
|   |-- /api                 # API call functions
|   |-- /assets              # Static assets
|   |-- /components          # Reusable UI components
|   |-- /contexts            # React Context for state
|   |-- /hooks               # Custom hooks
|   |-- /pages               # Page-level components
|   |-- /utils               # Helper functions
|   |-- App.jsx              # Main app component
|   |-- main.jsx             # Application entry point
|-- .gitignore
|-- index.html
|-- package.json
|-- tailwind.config.js
|-- vite.config.js
```

## 3. Routes

| Path | Component | Description | Authentication |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| / | Home | Displays a list of all events. | Public |
| /events/:id | EventDetail | Shows the details of a single event. | Public |
| /signup | SignUp | Renders the user registration form. | Public |
| /signin | SignIn | Renders the user login form. | Public |
| /create-event | CreateEvent | A form to create a new event. | Protected |
| * | NotFound | A catch-all route for any undefined paths. | Public |

## 4. UI Layout and Components

- **Navbar**: Main navigation, with links changing based on auth state.
- **Layout**: A wrapper component for consistent page structure.
- **EventCard**: Displays a summary of an event on the home page.
- **EventDetail**: Displays all information for a single event.
- **SignUpForm / SignInForm**: Forms for user authentication.
- **CreateEventForm**: A form for adding new events (protected).
- **ProtectedRoute**: A component to guard routes that require authentication.
- **Button / Input**: Reusable form elements.
